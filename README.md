Among quant trading strategies, statistical arbitrage, trend following, and machine learning-based 
strategies are among the most commonly deployed. 

These strategies often attract significant attention due to their potential 
for generating profits and their adaptability to various market conditions. 


Machine Learning-Based Strategies: With the increasing availability of data and advances in machine learning techniques, more quant traders are incorporating machine learning models into their strategies. These models can analyze vast amounts of data to identify patterns and relationships that may not be apparent to human traders, potentially leading to more profitable trading decisions.

While these strategies are commonly deployed, it's essential to recognize that the prevalence of a particular strategy can vary depending on factors such as market conditions, regulatory constraints, and the expertise of the trading firm. Additionally, successful quant trading often involves combining multiple strategies to diversify risk and adapt to changing market dynamics.
